NAME  
     hsh – simple UNIX command line interpreter

SYNOPSIS  
     hsh

DESCRIPTION  
     hsh is a basic UNIX shell written in C. It reads input from standard input and executes commands similarly to /bin/sh.

     The shell supports the following features:
     - Execution of command-line programs found in the PATH
     - Built-in commands: exit, env
     - Parsing of input into arguments
     - Handling of invalid commands with proper error formatting

BUILTINS  
     The following built-in commands are supported:

     exit  
          Exit the shell.

     env  
          Display the current environment variables.

RETURN VALUES  
     Returns 0 on success. If a command is not found, an error message is printed and the program exits with status 127.
